      <h4>The full legal bit</h4>
      <p>
        Dasmio is a social media website and app designed as a forum for meeting
        new people, a place to have discussions and to share photos, live
        streaming, news and information. It is intended to be a fun place to
        visit and it is important to us (and for you) that it remains a safe and
        friendly environment so you agree that you will only use Badoo in a
        manner consistent with its purpose and which is in accordance with these
        terms and conditions, as well as the Dasmio Community Guidelines and
        Safety Tips (the “Terms”). When we mention Dasmio, we mean
        www.badoo.com, together with affiliated websites and applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you as user
        (“you”) and the Dasmio (“we” or “us”).
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        The Terms apply whenever you visit Badoo, whether or not you have chosen
        to register with us, so please read them carefully. By accessing, using,
        registering for or receiving services offered on Badoo you are accepting
        and agreeing to be bound by the Terms.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-5">
        IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE TERMS THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR
        USE THE APP OR SITE.
      </p>
      <h4>1. Use of the app and site and rules relating to Content</h4>
      <h5>Who can use Dasmio?</h5>
      <p>
        Dasmio is a meeting place for adults. You may only use Dasmio, including
        any of its features, or become a registered member if you are 18 years
        old or older (or the age of majority in the country in which you reside
        if that happens to be greater than 18).
      </p>
      <p>
        You warrant that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter
        into and be bound by the Terms and that by using Dasmio you will not be
        violating any law or regulation of the country in which you are
        resident. You are solely responsible for your compliance with all
        applicable local laws and regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        You further warrant that you have not been convicted of, nor are subject
        to any court order relating to assault, violence, sexual misconduct or
        harassment.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Are there any rules relating to personal data like my email address?
      </h5>
      <p>
        You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your
        individual profile page (“Profile”) whether in relation to you or any
        other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone
        numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking
        details, or place of work). If you do choose to reveal any personal data
        about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at
        your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing
        details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any
        other circumstances. You are required to follow our Guidelines and
        Safety Tips when doing so.
      </p>
      <h5>What about other people’s personal data, can I use it?</h5>
      <p>
        You may only use other Dasmio users’ personal data to the extent that
        your use of it matches Dasmio purpose of allowing people to meet one
        another. When using Dasmio Live, you may not film other people, whether
        or not they are Dasmio users, unless you have informed them that the
        footage will be livestreamed via Dasmio Live and given them an
        opportunity to exclude themselves from the footage. You may not use
        other users’ information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or
        to make unlawful threats. Dasmio reserves the right to terminate your
        account, or prevent access to its features if you misuse other users’
        information.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Some of my friends want to see all the people I’m chatting with. Can I
        tell them my password and let them log on as me?
      </h5>
      <p>
        The short answer is no. Only you are authorised to access your account
        with Dasmio. You must not share your password with anyone or let anyone
        else access your account as this jeopardises the security of all of the
        Content and personal data that you have submitted to Dasmio. You are
        responsible for keeping your password secret and secure. If you don’t,
        Dasmio is not liable for any unauthorised access to your account. If you
        suspect that someone has gained access to your account, you must let us
        know immediately by visiting Feedback page and telling us of your
        suspicions or concerns. You must also immediately change your password.
        Dasmio reserves the right to terminate your account if you violate our
        rules on keeping your password secure.
      </p>

        general public. If you do not want such Content to be viewed by others,
        then you can opt to use the private folders and select the person to
        whom you wish to give access. If you still do not want such Content to
        be viewed by others, then you should not upload it to Dasmio. We reserve
        the right (without obligation) at our sole discretion and without giving
        you notice, to remove or edit, limit or block access to any Content that
        you upload or submit to Dasmio without any incurring liability to you.
        We have no obligation to display any Content that you submit to Dasmio,
        nor to check the accuracy or truthfulness of any Content submitted to
        Dasmio, nor to monitor your use or the use of other users of Dasmio.
      </p>
      <h4>Anything else I need to know?</h4>

        is publicly available. They will not have a Profile but may have limited

        met. We may change or update the criteria from time to time without
        prior notice and at our discretion.
