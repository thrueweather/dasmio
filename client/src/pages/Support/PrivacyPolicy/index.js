      <h1>OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU</h1>
      <p>
        At Dasmio your privacy is a top priority. Your privacy is at the core of
        the way we design and build the services and products you know and love,
        so that you can fully trust them and focus on building meaningful
        connections. We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you
        provide us with your information and we do not take this light.
      </p>
      <h4>We do not compromise with your privacy</h4>
      <p>
        We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We
        involve experts from various fields, including legal, security,
        engineering, product design and others to make sure that no decision is
        taken without respect for your privacy.
      </p>
      <h4>We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data.</h4>
      <p>
        Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that
        insufficient information and overly complicated language are common
        issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we have
        written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We
        actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy
        practices!
      </p>
      <h4>We work hard to keep your information secure</h4>
      <p>
        We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We
        constantly update our security practices and invest in our security
        efforts to enhance the safety of your information.
      </p>
      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
      <h4>Where this Privacy Policy applies</h4>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services
        operated by Tinder. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our
        “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added
        links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services. <br /> Some
        services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular
        service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy
        Policy -- applies.
      </p>
      <h4>1. Information we collect</h4>
      <p>
        It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections
        without some information about you, such as basic profile details and
        the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information
        generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as
        information from third parties, like when you access our services
        through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into
        more detail below.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Information you give us</h4>

      <p>
        {" "}
        • When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login
        credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to
        work, such as your gender and date of birth.
      </p>
      <p>
        • When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional
        information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests
        and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and
        videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow
        us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you
        choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in
        certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual
        orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this
        information, you consent to our processing of that information.
      </p>
      <p>
        • When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from
        us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide
        us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit
        or credit card number or other financial information.
      </p>
      <p>
        • When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your
        insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and
        testimonials.
      </p>
      <p>
        • When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests,
        we collect the information that you use to register or enter.
      </p>
      <p>
        • If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you
        give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these
        interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of
        service.
      </p>
      <p>
        • If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of
        other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf
        to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that
        you give us in order to complete your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the
        content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Information collected when you use our services</h4>
      <p>
        When you use our services, we collect information about which features
        you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our
        services. See below for more details:
      </p>
      <h4>3.1 Usage information</h4>
      <p>
        We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance
        how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you’ve
        been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you,
        referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you
        interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with,
        time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and
        receive).
      </p>
      <h4>3.2 Device information</h4>
      <p>
        We collect information from and about the device (s) you use to access
        our services, including:
      </p>
      <p>
        • Hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and
        type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app
        crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google’s AAID and Apple’s IDFA, both
        of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into
        your device’ settings), browser type, version and language, operating
        system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other
        technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g.,
        IMEI/UDID and MAC address);
      </p>
      <p>
        • Information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your
        service provider and signal strength;
      </p>
      <p>
        • Information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and
        compasses.
      </p>
      <h4>3.3 Other information with your consent</h4>
      <p>
        If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation
        (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service
        and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.
        The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when
        you aren’t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly
        permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect
        your geolocation, we will not collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we
        may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish
        a photo, video or streaming on the services).
